These syntax trees were automatically generated, then carefully corrected by hand.  Please report any errors you encounter.


Current markup scheme:

Cat = Part-of-speech Category  
Rule = Rule used to combine nodesâ€”some of these are arbitrary, some make meaningful distinctions (for example, when two nouns are connected together, we have different rules differentiating apposition, genitive modification, or two nouns conjoined/juxtaposed without conjunction in between).  
Start = indicates starting position of the node in the tree  
End = indicates ending position of the node in the tree (at the word level start & end would be the same; at a higher node, e.g., a multi-word phrase, the starting & ending position indicates the span of the multi-word phrase)  
Person = grammatical person  
Number = grammatical number  
Gender = grammatical gender  
Case = grammatical case  
Degree = degree of adjectives  
Tense = grammatical tense of verbs  
Voice = grammatical voice of verbs  
Mood = grammatical mood of verbs  
Relative = appears only with pronouns, will have True value if pronoun is a Relative pronoun  
Personal = appears only with pronouns, will have True value if pronoun is a Personal pronoun  
Demonstrative = appears only with pronouns, will have True value if pronoun is a Demonstrative pronoun  
Interrogative = appears only with pronouns, will have True value if pronoun is an Interrogative pronoun  
Unicode = Unicode of surface text  
UnicodeLemma = Unicode of lexical lemma  
morphId = morphId was developed as unique ID for building our translation memory & a host of other interlinear tools  
nodeId = BBCCCVVVWWWSSSL as previously noted, where WWW represents the beginning position (the Nth word) of a node/sub-tree
SSS represents the SPAN of a node (how many words it covers) L (Level) is used to distinguish nodes which have the same span (in cases of non-branching nodes)  
 
The following only occur in non-terminal nodes:

ClType = This occurs only for CL nodes. By default, there is no Type value--all clauses with V or VC (any verbal form) have no value. It is the clauses without a V or VC (any verbal form) that have Type value to distinguish Verbless from VerbElided clauses  
HasDet = Has True value when a phrase has a determiner included in it
